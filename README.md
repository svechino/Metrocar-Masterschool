# Metrocar-Masterschool
This project aims to analyze the customer funnel of Metrocar, a ride-sharing app, to identify areas for improvement and optimization.

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Metrocar's data to gain insights and provide actionable recommendations. The initial phase of the project involved data investigation and queries performed using Bookeeper Studio in PostgreSQL. CSV files containing relevant data were then processed in Tableau to create informative charts and develop insights: 

* Data_for_Tableau.sql
* SQLQuery_funnel.sql


The analysis covers various aspects of Metrocar's business, including customer funnel analysis, platform performance, age group behavior, surge pricing strategies, and ride completion rates. By leveraging data visualization techniques in Tableau, we were able to identify key trends, patterns, and areas of improvement.

The project aims to provide Metrocar with valuable insights for strategic decision-making and optimizing their operations. The interactive dashboards and visualizations generated through this analysis allow stakeholders to explore the data, uncover meaningful insights, and develop effective strategies to enhance the overall customer experience and drive business growth.

By combining the power of data investigation and queries in Bookeeper Studio with the visual capabilities of Tableau, this project offers a holistic approach to data analysis, enabling Metrocar to make data-driven decisions and gain a competitive edge in the ride-hailing industry
